SQL Account provides users with the option to backup their database into their local computer or a cloud drive storage. Users can perform backups as frequently as daily or weekly and have full ownership over their backups, allowing them to restore them at any time without additional charges.

## Why must I backup my database?

In any situation, it is always useful to have a backup copy of your work. Regularly backing up your SQL Account data is beneficial for several reasons:

1. Faster data recovery in emergency situations

2. Ability to perform cross checking and comparisons with past data

3. Protection against ransomware attacks and cyber crimes

4. Easy and secure sharing of data within the company
