## MyInvois Integration

1. The onboarding process consists of 3 steps:
    1. [E-Invoice Start Date](#e-invoice-start-date)
    2. [Production Credentials & Intermediary](#production-credentials--intermediary)
    3. [Sandbox Credentials & Intermediary](#sandbox-credentials--intermediary)

:::danger[Note]
You can skip 1 & 2 entirely and setup **[Sandbox credentials & Intermediary](#sandbox-credentials--intermediary)** alone for **Testing/Training** purposes.

### MyInvois Environment (Production/Sandbox)

**Production**: All your submitted E-Invoices will be acknowledged by LHDN directly.

**Sandbox**: Information sent to the Sandbox (testing environment) will be solely for testing purposes and no penalty will be imposed.

Follow the table below to setup your desired Environment:

|Start Date| Production Credentials | Sandbox Credentials| Your Environment|
|-|-|-|-|
|Current Date (e.g. Today)|❌|✅|Sandbox|
|Future Date (e.g. 1/7/2025)|❌|✅|Sandbox|
|Current Date (e.g. Today)|✅|❌|Production|
|Future Date (e.g. 1/7/2025)|✅|❌|Production after 1/7/2025|
|Current Date (e.g. Today)|✅|✅|Production with Test Validation enabled|
|Future Date (e.g. 1/7/2025)|✅|✅|Sandbox first, Production after 1/7/2025|

### E-Invoice Start Date

Purpose of the **E-Invoice Start Date**:

- Manage the ability to submit e-invoices in the **Production** environment. (You will only be able to start submitting e-invoices **after** the selected start date.)
- If you begin with the **Sandbox (Testing)** environment and have completed setting up your **Production** credentials, you will be prompted to activate your Production environment 7 days before the chosen start date.
