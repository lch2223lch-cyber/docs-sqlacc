## Submission

In the E-Invoice system, there are few types of documents that can be submitted. The table below shows how each document type in SQL Account is mapped to its corresponding E-Invoice document type. Refer to each section for more detailed information on the specific document types.

| SQL Account Document Type                                     | E-Invoice Document Type           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |

| [Credit Note](e-invoice#credit-note)                          | Credit Note                       |
| [Debit Note](e-invoice#debit-note)                            | Debit Note                        |

| [Purchase Invoice](e-invoice#purchase-invoice--cash-purchase) | Self-Billed Invoice               |
| [Cash Purchase](e-invoice#purchase-invoice--cash-purchase)    | Self-Billed Invoice               |
| [Purchase Returned](e-invoice#purchase-returned)              | Self-Billed Credit Note           |

### Single Submission

1. Click on **MyInvois** > **Submit E-Invoice**

    ![sales-invoice-submit-eiv](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/sales-invoice-submit-eiv.png)

2. If the submission is valid, you will see the screen below, where you can see the validated Invoice info from LHDN directly.

    :::info[NOTE]
    Ensure that all required fields are correctly filled before submission to avoid errors. If the submission is invalid, you will need to correct the issues and resubmit.
    :::

    ![sales-invoice-valid](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/sales-invoice-valid.png)

### Batch Submission

In the scenario where you already issued a lot of invoices but yet to submit E-Invoice, you can utilize the `Batch Submission` feature to submit them in single operation.

1. Click on **MyInvois** > **Batch Submit E-Invoice**

    ![batch-submission-button](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/batch-submission-button.png)

2. Apply the desired date range and untick any invoices that you do not wish to submit yet, then proceed to **Submit**.

    ![batch-submission-filter](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/batch-submission-filter.png)

3. Refer to **Status** column for each E-Invoice status. If there's any errors, go to the specific invoice and update the incorrect details then retry submission again.

    ![batch-submission-status](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/batch-submission-status.png)

4. Go back to browse screen, click **Refresh** to see the updated status.

    ![batch-submission-refresh](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/batch-submission-refresh.png)

## Test E-Invoice Validation

:::important
The validation process utilizes the MyInvois Sandbox environment, meaning the documents will appear in your MyInvois Portal (Sandbox/Pre-production).

To use this feature, you must complete the [Sandbox Credential Setup](onboarding#e-invoice-validation-setup) beforehand.
:::

If you do not have the necessary permissions to submit an E-Invoice, you can now validate the E-Invoice during the issuance process.

This ensures that the invoice can be successfully submitted at a later stage.

1. After issuing an invoice, click **MyInvois** > **Test E-Invoice Validation**

    ![test-einvoice-validation](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/test-einvoice-validation-button.png)

2. If there's some missing data, error list or dialog will be shown, you can update the incorrect data and try validate again.

    Example error dialog:

    ![test-einvoice-error](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/test-einvoice-validation-error.png)

3. If the validation is successful, you will see the following confirmation screen:

    ![test-einvoice-result](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/test-einvoice-validation-result.png)

## Consolidate

When the buyer does not require an e-Invoice, the supplier will issue a regular receipt, which does not need to be submitted for IRBM validation.

However, you are required to aggregate these transactions monthly and submit a consolidated e-Invoice to IRBM within **seven calendar days after the month's end**.

1. Click on **MyInvois** > **Consolidate E-Invoice**

    ![consolidate-button](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/consolidate-button.png)

2. Select the documents to consolidate:
   1. Choose the desired date range
   2. Tick **Include unsubmitted E-Invoices** if you want to include invoices with **E-Invoice** submission type. Refer to [Step 4](e-invoice#sales-invoice--cash-sales)
   3. Click **Apply**

    ![consolidate-filter](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/consolidate-filter.png)

3. Review the aggregated invoice details and click **Submit**

    ![consolidate-review](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/consolidate-review.png)

4. If the consolidated E-Invoice is submitted successfully, you will see the following confirmation screen:

    ![consolidate-success](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/consolidate-success.png)

## Cancellation

At the **first 72 hours** of an submitted invoice, you are able to **cancel** the e-invoice, then re-submit the same invoice again without issuing CN/DN.

In the first 72 hours period, you shall cancel the invoice and resubmit when:

 1. There is a mistake in the submitted e-invoice.
 2. Buyer rejected the invoice and you agreed with the rejection.

To cancel a submitted e-invoice:

1. Go to **MyInvois** > **Cancel Validated E-Invoice**.

    ![sales-invoice-cancel-button](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/sales-invoice-cancel-button.png)

2. Enter the reason for cancellation then Click **Initiate Cancellation**. To dismiss the dialog, Click **Keep Document**.

    ![sales-invoice-cancel-reason](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/sales-invoice-cancel-reason.png)

3. To verify the latest status, go to **MyInvois** > **Check E-Invoice Status**.

    ![sales-invoice-cancelled](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/sales-invoice-cancelled.png)

## Report

Preview the report and you can see the E-Invoice validation QR code is embedded in the invoice.

![sales-invoice-preview](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/sales-invoice-preview.png)

    If the invoice status is marked as invalid, a list of errors will be displayed. You can use this information to correct the invoice and resubmit it.
    :::

    ![sales-invoice-check-status-invalid](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/sales-invoice-check-status-invalid.png)

### Batch Check Status

In certain situations, the status of your E-Invoices may not reflect the latest updates due to various factors such as:

- Slow or unstable internet connectivity
- Manual cancellation of an E-Invoice within the MyInvois Portal
- E-Invoice status showing as Submitted without further updates

To ensure that you are viewing the most up-to-date status of your E-Invoices, follow these steps:

   1. Click the **MyInvois** button.
   2. Select **Batch Check E-Invoice Status**.

This process will retrieve the latest status for all submitted documents, ensuring that your records are accurate and up to date.

    ![batch-check-status](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/batch-check-status.png)

## Purchase Documents Import

SQL Account offers two methods for importing purchase documents from the E-Invoice system:

- [Single Import](#single-import): Enables you to import individual documents.

To ensure proper import, it's important to understand how the document types in SQL Account are mapped to those received from the E-Invoice system. The table below shows how the document types in the SQL Account are mapped to those received from the E-Invoice system:

| SQL Account Document Type | E-Invoice Document Type |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Purchase Invoice          | Invoice                 |
| Cash Purchase             | Invoice                 |
| Purchase Returned         | Credit Note             |
| Purchase Debit Note       | Debit Note              |
