## Submission

In the E-Invoice system, there are few types of documents that can be submitted. The table below shows how each document type in SQL Account is mapped to its corresponding E-Invoice document type. Refer to each section for more detailed information on the specific document types.

| SQL Account Document Type                                     | E-Invoice Document Type           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |

### Single Submission

1. Click on **MyInvois** > **Submit E-Invoice**

    ![sales-invoice-submit-eiv](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/sales-invoice-submit-eiv.png)

2. If the submission is valid, you will see the screen below, where you can see the validated Invoice info from LHDN directly.

    :::info[NOTE]
    Ensure that all required fields are correctly filled before submission to avoid errors. If the submission is invalid, you will need to correct the issues and resubmit.
    :::

    ![sales-invoice-valid](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/sales-invoice-valid.png)

### Batch Submission

In the scenario where you already issued a lot of invoices but yet to submit E-Invoice, you can utilize the `Batch Submission` feature to submit them in single operation.

1. Click on **MyInvois** > **Batch Submit E-Invoice**

    ![batch-submission-button](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/batch-submission-button.png)

2. Apply the desired date range and untick any invoices that you do not wish to submit yet, then proceed to **Submit**.

    ![batch-submission-filter](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/batch-submission-filter.png)

3. Refer to **Status** column for each E-Invoice status. If there's any errors, go to the specific invoice and update the incorrect details then retry submission again.

    ![batch-submission-status](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/batch-submission-status.png)

4. Go back to browse screen, click **Refresh** to see the updated status.

    ![batch-submission-refresh](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/batch-submission-refresh.png)

### Resolving Submitting Status

Submitting status is not a common status you will encounter. It will only stuck at submitting status during the event SQL Account fails to receive response from MyInvois Portal when the document may or may not be submitted. This mechanism is to **prevent double submission**.

Below show the icon of submitting status, it is a **red** submitted icon.

    ![submitting-status-detail](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/submitting-status-detail.png)

    ![submitting-status-browse](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/submitting-status-browse.png)

There are 2 way to resolve submitting status.

    - Using [refresh status (Single Document)](#refresh-status-single-document).
    - Using [batch refresh status](#batch-refresh-status).

1. After refresh status is clicked, SQL Account will automatically check if the document was submitted successfully to MyInvois Portal. In the event that:

    1. Document is **successfully found** in MyInvois Portal. Confirmation dialog will be prompted. (1) show the current document number that is being resolved. Select the correct document and click **OK** (2) to complete resolving submitting status.

        ![submitting-status-resolving](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/submitting-status-resolving.png)

    2. Document is **not found** in MyInvois Portal. Action dialog will be prompted.

        ![submitting-status-resolving-error](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/submitting-status-resolving-error.png)

        :::warning
        Sometimes it take a long time for the submitted document to appear in MyInvois Portal. Please ensure it has not been submitted before Reset E-Invoice status to avoid double submission.
        :::

        - Click **Search again** to retry find from MyInvois Portal again.
        - Click **Reset E-Invoice status** to remove submitting status, so you are able to resubmit the document again (This may lead to duplicate submission).

## Test E-Invoice Validation

:::important
The validation process utilizes the MyInvois Sandbox environment, meaning the documents will appear in your MyInvois Portal (Sandbox/Pre-production).

To use this feature, you must complete the [Sandbox Credential Setup](onboarding#sandbox-credentials--intermediary) beforehand.
:::

If you do not have the necessary permissions to submit an E-Invoice, you can now validate the E-Invoice during the issuance process.

This ensures that the invoice can be successfully submitted at a later stage.

1. After issuing an invoice, click **MyInvois** > **Test E-Invoice Validation**

    ![test-einvoice-validation](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/test-einvoice-validation-button.png)

2. If there's some missing data, error list or dialog will be shown, you can update the incorrect data and try validate again.

    Example error dialog:

    ![test-einvoice-error](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/test-einvoice-validation-error.png)

3. If the validation is successful, you will see the following confirmation screen:

    ![test-einvoice-result](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/test-einvoice-validation-result.png)

## Consolidate

When the buyer does not require an e-Invoice, the supplier will issue a regular receipt, which does not need to be submitted for IRBM validation.

However, you are required to aggregate these transactions monthly and submit a consolidated e-Invoice to IRBM within **seven calendar days after the month's end**.

1. Click on **MyInvois** > **Consolidate E-Invoice**

    ![consolidate-button](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/consolidate-button.png)

2. Select the documents to consolidate:
   1. Choose the desired date range
   2. Tick **Include unsubmitted E-Invoices** if you want to include invoices with **E-Invoice** submission type. Refer to [Step 4](e-invoice#sales-invoice--cash-sales)
   3. Click **Apply**

    ![consolidate-filter](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/consolidate-filter.png)

3. Review the aggregated invoice details and click **Submit**

    ![consolidate-review](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/consolidate-review.png)

4. If the consolidated E-Invoice is submitted successfully, you will see the following confirmation screen:

    ![consolidate-success](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/consolidate-success.png)

## Cancellation

At the **first 72 hours** of an submitted invoice, you are able to **cancel** the e-invoice, then re-submit the same invoice again without issuing CN/DN.

In the first 72 hours period, you shall cancel the invoice and resubmit when:

 1. There is a mistake in the submitted e-invoice.
 2. Buyer rejected the invoice and you agreed with the rejection.

To cancel a submitted e-invoice:

1. Go to **MyInvois** > **Cancel Validated E-Invoice**.

    ![sales-invoice-cancel-button](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/sales-invoice-cancel-button.png)

2. Enter the reason for cancellation then Click **Initiate Cancellation**. To dismiss the dialog, Click **Keep Document**.

    ![sales-invoice-cancel-reason](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/sales-invoice-cancel-reason.png)

3. To verify the latest status, go to **MyInvois** > **Check E-Invoice Status**.

    ![sales-invoice-cancelled](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/sales-invoice-cancelled.png)

## Report

Preview the report and you can see the E-Invoice validation QR code is embedded in the invoice.

![sales-invoice-preview](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/sales-invoice-preview.png)

## Refresh Status

You can easily check the latest status of an invoice in SQL Account to ensure it has been submitted and processed correctly.

### Refresh Status (Single Document)

1. Click on **MyInvois** > **Check E-Invoice Status** (1) or **Icon** (2).

    ![sales-invoice-refresh-status-button](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/sales-invoice-refresh-status-button.png)

2. You will be able to see the current status of the submitted invoice, along with the QR code and a validation page.

    ![sales-invoice-refresh-status-valid](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/sales-invoice-refresh-status-valid.png)

    :::info[NOTE]
    If the invoice status is marked as invalid, a list of errors will be displayed. You can use this information to correct the invoice and resubmit it.
    :::

    ![sales-invoice-refresh-status-invalid](../../../static/img/myinvois/einvoice/sales-invoice-refresh-status-invalid.png)

### Batch Refresh Status

In certain situations, the status of your E-Invoices may not reflect the latest updates due to various factors such as:

- Slow or unstable internet connectivity
- Manual cancellation of an E-Invoice within the MyInvois Portal
- E-Invoice status showing as Submitted without further updates

To ensure that you are viewing the most up-to-date status of your E-Invoices, follow these steps:

   1. Click the **MyInvois** button.
   2. Select **Batch Check E-Invoice Status**.

This process will retrieve the latest status for all submitted documents, ensuring that your records are accurate and up to date.

## Import

SQL Account offers two methods for importing sales or purchase documents from the E-Invoice system:

- [Batch Import](#batch-import): Allows you to import multiple documents at once.
- [Linking](#linking): Allows you to link the existing document with received E-Invoice document.

To ensure proper import, it's important to understand how the document types in SQL Account are mapped to those received from the E-Invoice system. The table below shows how the document types in the SQL Account are mapped to those received from the E-Invoice system:

| SQL Account Document Type | E-Invoice Document Type |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Sales Invoice             | Self-Billed Invoice     |
| Cash Sales                | Self-Billed Invoice     |
| Credit Note               | Self-Billed Credit Note |
| Debit Note                | Self-Billed Debit Note  |
| Receipt Voucher           | Self-Billed Invoice     |
| Purchase Invoice          | Invoice                 |
| Cash Purchase             | Invoice                 |
| Purchase Returned         | Credit Note             |
